HI!
you are using a simple setup script that I enjoy using for a niri configuration, these are basically my dotfiles but they work :D

To use any of this stuff you need to do this command:

```
sudo pacman -Syu
git clone https://github.com/XansiVA/noctalia-shell-expanded.git
cd ~/noctalia-shell-expanded
sudo chmod 700 Noctalia.sh
/.Noctalia.sh 
```

make sure you are in the directory of this file.
