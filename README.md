HI!
you are using a simple setup script that I enjoy using for a niri configuration, these are basically my dotfiles but they work :D

To use any of this stuff you need to do these commands:

```
sudo pacman -Syu
git clone https://github.com/XansiVA/noctalia-shell-expanded.git
cd ~/noctalia-shell-expanded
sudo chmod 700 Noctalia.sh
./Noctalia.sh 
```

Just do these things you should be fine.
everything is only as it needs to. if something is not to how you like it you can simply edit them with the Noctalia shellscript
all the data contained is in there.
